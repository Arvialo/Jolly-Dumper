# Jolly-Dumper

#### Everybody knows the story of Jolly Jumper, the famous horse !

#### But do you know Jolly Dumper, the famous database dumper ? 

```This tool will be useful for pentesters or people wanting to learn mysql basics. This enables you to discover some databases.```

```For example, you can use it as part of a ctf. ```

On my opinion, the 3 main perks are:
1. loading speed (the requests are made one after the other)
2. the fact that it is well organized and structured --> better understanding
3. ease of use
